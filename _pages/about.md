Welcome! Iâ€™m **Dr Jamie B. Thompson**, an evolutionary biologist and ethnobotanist, with a deep research focus on plant diversity, especially **cacti and other succulents**.

I am the recipient of the Linnean Society's **Irene Manton Prize** (2025), recognising the best botanical PhD thesis.  I also just won a Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship, to continue working on origins of plant diversity.  Here, I am doing pilot studies on my favourite group (cacti), then expanding analyses to all flowering plants, and beyond!

I have an odd brain and have lots of diverse interests.  My research focusses:
- Evolution, diversification and historical biogeography of cacti and other succulents
- Climate-dependent diversification through time, in orchids and other plants
- Origins of pollinator diversity, and their consequences on diversification, in orchids and bromeliads
- Ethnobotany, and how evolutionary methods can predict where to find new plant drugs
- Cultural evolution of medicinal plant knowledge, to reveal deep ancestral origins and new adaptive strategies

But I am also very interested in other things, including mass extinctions, trait evolution, and other things (even non-plants sometimes).

I teach undergraduate courses in conservation biology, and have taught population genetics previously.  I supervise BSc research students on topics as diverse as the evolution of infanticide in primates, predictors of viral diversity in bats, and whether hummingbirds accelerated bromeliad diversification.  I co-supervise PhD students on drivers of geophyte evolution, and the ethnobotany of traditional Chinese medicine.

Ongoing projects:
- A database of morphological, phylogenetic, and ecological data for Cactaceae for >1,000 species (CactEcoDB, invited by Nature Scientific Data)
- A continuous-space 3D reconstruction of historical biogeography in Cactaceae using the biggest cactus phylogeny
- Exploring morphological evolution in Cactaceae to reveal drivers of selection
- Origins of diverse pollinator strategies in orchids and bromeliads, and whether this accelerates diversification
- A cross-cultural database of medicinal plants used by Austronesian cultures, and ancestral reconstructions of plant use
- Origins of seed size variation in Legumes, and how this is shaped by ecological selection globally
